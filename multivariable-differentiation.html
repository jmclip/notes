<p>The first derivative is applying the definition of derivatives on the function, and it can be expressed as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f&#39;(x),  ~~ y&#39;,  ~~ \frac{d}{dx}f(x), ~~ \frac{dy}{dx}\]</span></p>
<p>We can keep applying the differentiation process to functions that are themselves derivatives. The derivative of <span class="math inline">\(f&#39;(x)\)</span> with respect to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, would then be <span class="math display">\[f&#39;&#39;(x)=\lim\limits_{h\to 0}\frac{f&#39;(x+h)-f&#39;(x)}{h}\]</span> and we can therefore call it the <strong>Second derivative:</strong></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f&#39;&#39;(x), ~~ y&#39;&#39;, ~~ \frac{d^2}{dx^2}f(x), ~~ \frac{d^2y}{dx^2}\]</span></p>
<p>Similarly, the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(f&#39;&#39;(x)\)</span> would be called the third derivative and is denoted <span class="math inline">\(f&#39;&#39;&#39;(x)\)</span>. And by extension, the <strong>nth derivative</strong> is expressed as <span class="math inline">\(\frac{d^n}{dx^n}f(x)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{d^ny}{dx^n}\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
f(x) &amp;=x^3\\
f^{\prime}(x) &amp;=3x^2\\
f^{\prime\prime}(x) &amp;=6x \\
f^{\prime\prime\prime}(x) &amp;=6\\
f^{\prime\prime\prime\prime}(x) &amp;=0\\
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>Earlier, we said that <a href="sequences-derivatives.html#continuity-and-derivatives">if a function is differentiable at a given point, then it must be continuous</a>. Further, if <span class="math inline">\(f&#39;(x)\)</span> is itself continuous, then <span class="math inline">\(f(x)\)</span> is called <strong>continuously differentiable</strong>. All of this matters because many of our findings about optimization rely on differentiation, and so we want our function to be differentiable in as many layers. A function that is continuously differentiable infinitely is called <strong>smooth</strong>. Some examples include:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
f(x) &amp;= x^2 \\
f(x) &amp;= e^x
\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>

<p>Our task:</p>
<ul>
<li>Obtain likelihood (summary estimator)</li>
<li>Derive maximum likelihood estimators for <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^2\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
L(\mu, \sigma^2 | \mathbf{Y} ) &amp;\propto \prod_{i=1}^{n} f(Y_{i}|\mu, \sigma^2) \\  
&amp;\propto  \prod_{i=1}^{N} \frac{\exp[ - \frac{ (Y_{i} - \mu)^2 }{2\sigma^2} ]}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} \\
&amp;\propto \frac{\exp[ -\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{(Y_{i} - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}  ]}{ (2\pi)^{n/2} \sigma^{2n/2} }

\]</span></p>
<p>Taking the logarithm, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[l(\mu, \sigma^2|\mathbf{Y} ) = -\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{(Y_{i} - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} - \frac{n}{2} \log(2 \pi) - \frac{n}{2} \log (\sigma^2)\]</span></p>
<p>Let’s find <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\sigma}^{2}\)</span> that maximizes log-likelihood.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
l(\mu, \sigma^2|\mathbf{Y} ) &amp;=  -\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{(Y_{i} - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2} - \frac{n}{2} \log (\sigma^2) \\
\frac{\partial l(\mu, \sigma^2)|\mathbf{Y} )}{\partial \mu }  &amp;= \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{2(Y_{i} - \mu)}{2\sigma^2} \\
\frac{\partial l(\mu, \sigma^2)|\mathbf{Y})}{\partial \sigma^2} &amp;=  -\frac{n}{2\sigma^2}  + \frac{1}{2\sigma^4} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_{i} - \mu)^2

<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
0 &amp;= -\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{2(Y_{i} - \widehat{\mu})}{2\widehat{\sigma}^2} \\

\end{aligned}
\]</span></p>
<p>Solving for <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\mu}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\widehat{\sigma}^2\)</span> yields,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{aligned}
\widehat{\mu} &amp;= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_{i} }{n} \\

<p><span class="math display">\[

<p>Taking derivatives and evaluating at MLE’s yields,</p>
